An addon for World of Warcraft that displays the public or officer guild note of a character when the character talks in guild or officer chat. Display on party and raid chat is also supported. As well as displaying the note upon login and logout.

In a guild with many alts, this facilitates identifying who is talking, when the names of the main characters are kept in the public or officer notes of alts. To avoid redundancy, matching names and notes will not display. Matching can be refined by normalising characters. For visibility, it is possible to choose the colour in which the note is displayed.
